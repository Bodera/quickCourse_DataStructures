# Introduction

Welcome to the introductory lesson of data structures, the goal of this lesson is to make you understand why this content on data structures is even needed in the first place for coding interviews. Why do you need to know about data structures in the context of coding interviews?

Coding interviews are very interesting and unique type of interviews. The premise that tech companies are operating under when they conduct these coding/algorithm interviews, is that they are a solid way to test whether a software engineer is a good **problem solver**. They believe that these kind of interview are a good tool to assess a candidate's problem-solving ability. And they also don't really require that much theoretical knowledge.

If you take a look at other fields, let's say law or medicine, exams in those fields tend to test candidates on knowledge. Coding interviews works a little different, in a matter of fact the majority questions provided on these interviews could be answered, at least conceptually, by people who has zero background in computer science or might not even be able to code at all.

However this does not mean that coding interviews require absolutely zero knowledge, because they do require. They require mainly two types of knowledge: 

- Foundation in coding: in a coding interview you not only need to solve the problem conceptually, you also need to transcribe that solution into code.
- Data structures: you can think of them as the tools that you're going to be using to solve these problems that you'll be given on coding interviews. 

The bad news is that there is a lot of content to cover about data structures, in fact there're an entire academic fields about data structures and how they relate to algorithms which involves math and complexity. The good news is that in the context of coding interviews you actually don't need that much knowledge about data structures, the content needed is actually pretty well-defined and focused around a few very important foundational data structures that we're going to explore on the next lessons.

So think about data structures as the foundational knowledge that you're gonna need to tackle coding interviews and then the actual coding interview questions are gonna be the things that test your problem-solving ability and where you need to apply this data structures knowledge.
