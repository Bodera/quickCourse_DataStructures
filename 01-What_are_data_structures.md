# What are data structures?

If you're a complete beginner when it comes to data structures, you should come out of this lesson feeling empowered with the sense of clarity around what data structures are. If you're someone who's already familiar with data structures, maybe you're even well-versed in them, this lesson should serve as a healthy reminder that data structures are nothing but a pretty simple concept that you're gonna need for your coding interviews.

Now let's take a step back and look at coding or software engineering. What is coding from a very basic point of view? Coding or sofware engineering is really just manipulating data. But manipulating data in such a way that you can accomplish something. Let's suppose you're building a web app and you're working in the frontend, you might be making requests to the a backend in order to retrieve data so that you can be transforming that data into a human readable format to finally displaying that data on some interface. Similarly, if you're developing an API, you might be writing code that stores and retrieves data from a database that transforms that data then finally returns it to the client who asks for it. The point with the previous examples is the same, at a very elemental level all that you're really doing in coding or software engineering is manipulating data, there's even a running joke which states that all that software engineers do on a day-to-day basis during their jobs is move data from one place to another, from one service to another. And you can see the true on that statement in the context of coding interviews, you'll be dealing with some sort of input data whether it be a list of numbers, or maybe a single word, then is expected to you manipulate that data in some way to perform a predefined action or archieve a predefined output.

So far, so clear, huh? Whetever you're coding, in software engineering, or at a coding interview, you're manipulating data. What am I getting at with this? That's where data structures come into play, manipulating data involves structuring that data, organizing it, and managing it. At this point, you're probably getting the hints, data structures are really just a way to organize and manage data. Before we define a slightly more precise definition of data structures, especially for the context of coding interviews, let's explore one more point home which is the following: you as a human being interacts with data structures every single day, emails, currency transactions, social networks, all these data mentioned are stored in some particular software, and sorted following a defined rule, and labeled accordingly you customizations. The point is, you are interacting with data, structuring it, and managing it, and this is you applyng data structures on your routine, and ironically, behind the scenes in the code that actually makes this looks so trivial, there are data structures organizing and managing that data.

So now going back to our definition of data structures let's try to be more specific, accordingly to Wikipedia a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

The image above illustrates some well known data structures, but at face value, all these drawings are collections of pieces of data. We've figures with arrows between them which implies some kind of relationship between these values. We also have a pattern that slightly remembers a real tree. And you can imagine that on this data values I might be able to perform operations, for instance, I might be able to take one element from one of this structures and remove it out. All these different data structures they happened to have their own names, they have different kinds of relationships between the data values that are part of them, and they have different functions and operations that you can perform on them.

The key thing for the context of coding interviews is gonna to be well-versed in all of the popular foundation of data structures to know all of these relationships between data values, all the functions and operations that these data structures support, and to know the benefits and downsides that all of these data structures have. So at this point, even if you're a complete beginner when it comes to data structures, you really shouldn't feel discouraged, if anything, you should feel encouraged because data structures are just a simple concept, a way to organize and manage data, they're a bunch of data values put together that have relationships between them, that you can manipulate by applying certain functions and operations on them, and they just happened to have fancy names like linked lists, or binary trees.
